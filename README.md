# Call for Code Honoring Everyday Heroes Challenge  

The recent pandemic has highlighted the often unsung heroes who serve us. Whether its the trusted doctor who provides the annual check-up, your child’s favorite mathematics teacher, or the driver delivering your weekly groceries: service is essential to our lives. As we all navigate our own versions of life in this new normal, it’s critical to acknowledge the strain experienced by those fulfilling our everyday needs – the everyday heroes. 

Technology can solve the world's biggest problems, and it has an integral role to play in bringing support to everyday heroes in a variety of ways. You can join the Call for Code community in contributing to the cause. IBM and Samsung have teamed up to deliver Call for Code: Honoring Everyday Heroes – a challenge that encourages developers and problem solvers around the world to build solutions for everyday heroes.

Those that Answer the Call are invited to create a solution to help or honor the lives of our everyday heroes. Submissions for the Challenge must be able to run on a Samsung tablet, smartphone, and/or wearable device and make use of one or more IBM open hybrid cloud technologies such as IBM Cloud or IBM Watson. Participants will also have access to Samsung toolkits, as well as data from The Weather Company

## An example

Application is designed to improve productivity of an everyday hero with a better user experience supported by Samsung Knox on a Samsung device using better information/notifications via IBM's Cloud. (Ex. A delivery person wearing a glove can instantly launch an app for delivery confirmation with just a single button press on a device. The app could also provide the fastest route for a delivery.)

Solution is well-documented, has a compelling demo, and is something an ecosystem (Samsung, IBM, telcos, Linux Foundation) can test and improve as an open source project right away.

### Samsung Knox SDK

Knox SDK extends the functionality of the standard Android SDK to provide granular access to device features, security options, customization settings, and more. Create tailored solutions by remapping hardware keys, designing kiosks, deploying policies by geographical location, and/or customizing the booting animation. Keep sensitive enterprise data secure by restricting access to settings, pre-configuring VPN and firewall settings, and allowing and blocking apps. Some of the key features of the Knox SDK include:

- Support for various authentication methods including biometrics (fingerprint/iris/facial recognition), Active Directory integration, secure certificate management, and forced two-factor authentication

- Flexible device management options to set granular device and app policies while adhering to strict standards such as Common Criteria

- Customize all aspects of the device, such as restricting apps, customizing system settings and boot-up animation/wallpaper, and remapping device keys

To read up more on the Samsung Knox SDK and to confirm if you have a supported device and OS, please refer to the following:

### Samsung Industry Toolkit: Reliable Device to Cloud Capabilities for Mobile

Sample Use Case: Field-based Solution for Health Care Workers to Capture and Analyze patient data

- Toolkit SDKs and Toolkit Agent will help mobile applications to reliably receive data from a mobile device or connected ioT Device and send to a cloud server
  application, which can be useful for developing app solutions for Everyday Hero situations, such as for health care workers,
  where an app that runs consistently in real-time conditions is important
- Functionality:
  - Sending a payload from server app, such as ML model or app data for a particular health care situation, to mobile app
  - Transferring data sourced from mobile app, such as app collected data (health care worker collected data) to server app
  - Providing a more stable and reliable Internet Connection for mobile devices that might experience poor connectivity by connecting them to a stable Master device
- Benefits:
  - Resilient to poor connectivity (loss of data connectivity) and app performance situations (app failure, user
    dependencies) by using Samsung Toolkit background agent application and cloud service
  - Removes need for developers to update app code or to build capability to update app with updated data during app use
  - Toolkit Agent will temporarily store any collected data when there is loss of connectivity and immediately transfer to the cloud when connectivity is re-established
