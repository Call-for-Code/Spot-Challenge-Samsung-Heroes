   NOTES:

   i) If you already have a Knox Partner Program account, you must use another email for this challenge. You can use a personal email (@gmail.com; etc.) or simply add "+test" after your current email (e.g., johnsmith+test@work.com). The email will also help to create another Samsung Account.

   ii) If you have an existing Samsung Account but do not have a Knox Partner Program account, you can use your existing Samsung Account if you wish.

3. The new email you used in the first step can now be used to create a new Samsung Account account.

## Getting Started Steps for Toolkit (Beta) Only)

If you plan to use the Toolkit (Beta) SDKs, you will need to do the following two things:

1. Register your devices into the Samsung Toolkit Device Registration web portal

2. Use the Knox Partner Program's Contact Us form to get in contact with the Toolkit Team to provide them with the storage destination for your data.

Step-by-step instructions can be downloaded from the Knox Partner Program's SDK Downloads > Samsung Toolkit (Beta) [section](https://partner.samsungknox.com/dashboard/download).
